             <p>
                I am an ambitious and motivated accountant with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Commerce (Accounting),
                a solid foundation in customer service, and a developing background in virtual assistance. I am
                an energetic, proactive individual who values integrity, honesty, and accountability. With experience in
                accounting, customer support, and administrative roles, I combine an eye for detail with exceptional problem-solving
                and communication skills. My dedication to delivering high-quality support extends to my volunteer work in Kenya, where I 
                empower young girls and supports local communities through medical and educational outreach programs.
